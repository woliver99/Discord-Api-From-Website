# Discord-Api-From-Website

 Do stuff you cant normaly do on Discord from a nice little html website.
 
 I am currently hosting the page on my [website](https://utilities.maplenetwork.me/discordapi/) if you dont want to download it.

## The page will not steel your Discord Token!

 Everything is done on the **client side** so nothing gets sent back to the server.
 
 If you are really worried just download the repository and open **index.html** and you should be fine.
